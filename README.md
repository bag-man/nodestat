This is a really simple script to display the servers CPU and RAM usage in real time with a pretty d3 bar graph. 

It requires socket.io and express to be ran. 

It has a few issues, firstly I think the CPU usage isn't the current average but rather the average since the script started, and secondly when there is 100% usage the bars get ruined. 

The plan was to make it have a lot more useful stats on, and a github issue tracker,twitter and even maybe a white board. But for the moment I am going to leave it as is, and move on to a new project!
