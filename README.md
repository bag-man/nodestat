This is a really simple script to display the servers CPU and RAM usage in real time with a pretty d3 bar graph. 

You can view a live version here: http://itsback.at

It requires socket.io and express to be ran. Just use:

    npm install
    
And the package.json will get the modules.

The plan was to make it have a lot more useful stats on, and a github issue tracker, twitter and even maybe a white board. But for the moment I am going to leave it as is, and move on to a new project!
